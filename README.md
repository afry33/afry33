## About Me
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a **Data Analyst** and **Developer** with a passion for blending data science, coding, and creative design. Currently, I'm pursuing my **Master of Science in Data Science** at **Illinois Institute of Technology**, after earning my **Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies: Computer Science & Literature** from **University of Central Florida**. 🎮💻

I thrive on transforming data into insightful visualizations, building predictive models, and crafting clean code. Here you’ll find my data projects and creations.

## Projects 🕹️

### [Runners Performance & Health Data Analysis](https://github.com/yourusername/runners-analysis)
This project analyzes a dataset of over **700K race entries**, focusing on runner performance, health metrics, and predictive modeling. By leveraging **Python** and **Jupyter**, I explored trends in race outcomes, identified key health indicators, and built predictive models to forecast runner performance and optimize training strategies. This project aims to inform product development strategies for sports brands and health applications by predicting future trends in runners' health and performance.

### [Health & Academic Performance Analysis](https://github.com/yourusername/student-grades-analysis)
This project investigates the factors influencing academic performance, with a specific focus on **health-related variables** such as diet, sleep patterns, and mental well-being. Using **SQL** and **EXCEL**, I conducted a multivariate analysis to explore correlations between student grades and lifestyle factors. The insights from this project can be applied to improve health and wellness programs within academic institutions and support evidence-based interventions to enhance student outcomes.

### [Running Product Market Trends & Forecasting](https://github.com/yourusername/running-product-analysis)
*Currently in progress...*

In this project, I aim to apply **predictive analytics** to running product sales data, identifying key factors influencing the demand for various running-related products. The goal is to utilize tools like **R** and **Tableau** to analyze sales trends, consumer behavior, and market shifts, ultimately forecasting future demand for running gear and health products. Once completed, this project will provide valuable insights for companies in the sports industry to make data-driven decisions and prepare for emerging trends in the running community.
